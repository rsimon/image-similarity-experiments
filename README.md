# Image Similarity Experiments

## yoloe-box-prompting

An example for finding similar instances of a pattern image (in the same or another image), using [YOLOE](https://docs.ultralytics.com/de/models/yoloe/). This experiment is (arguably) most similar to the [Box Prompting feature built into Roboflow](https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate/ai-labeling/box-prompting-ai-labeling).
